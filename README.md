Best practice for using a well with an old-school suction pump is to keep a
little water on hand with which to prime the pump. 

The pump on the name well can also grow a little dry sometimes, so here is a
bucket of components with which one might prime that pump, specifically for
organizational names. 

Example names and metasyntactic variables are just one category of
practice components one can use in exercises and examples, toys and tests.
Consider this repository as belonging to that category, a practice or
metasyntactic repository to use when whats in the repository matters some,
but not that much.
